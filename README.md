First year project making use of Finch Robot's API to draw shapes where a pencil is inserted in it's tail to display it 
- Created a text box making use of Java Swing's API which gave 3 options of R,T,Q(Draw rectanlge, trianlge, quit)
- Made sure input were within a bound (30cm-90cm)
- Depending on the shape, it needs to determine if it would be drawn correctly e.g For triangle we need to determine the sum of two shorter sides should be greater than the longest side
- Made use of beep sensor to indciate it has completed the shape
